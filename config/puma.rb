# Detect available virtual CPU cores. Used to autoâ€‘tune thread and worker counts

# Puma can serve each request in a thread from an internal thread pool.
# The `threads` method setting takes two numbers: a minimum and maximum.
# Any libraries that use thread pools should be configured to match
# the maximum value specified for Puma. Default is set to 5 threads for minimum
# and maximum; this matches Active Record's default thread pool size.
#
# Configure maximum threads available for Puma, defaulting to 5.

# Specifies the `port` that Puma will listen on to receive requests; default is 3000.
port Integer(ENV.fetch("PORT") { 3000 })

# Specifies the `environment` that Puma will run in.

# Use a single worker to ensure a single process (required for in-process Solid Queue with SQLite)
workers 0

# Use the `preload_app!` method when specifying a `workers` number.
# This directive tells Puma to first boot the application and load code
# before forking the application. This takes advantage of Copy On Write
# process behavior so workers use less memory.

# Solid Queue now runs in-process via an initializer, so the plugin is not needed.
# Allow `bin/rails restart` to restart Puma.
