        description: On October 28, 2021, Mark Zuckerberg had become the laughing
          stock of the internet after rebranding Facebook to Meta Platforms as part
          of his efforts to create an online Metaverse.
        p1: Three years later, it’s looking increasingly like the internet is becoming
          the laughing stock of Mark Zuckerberg, as the Metaverse grows ever closer
          to reality.
        p10: 'In a single sentence: Meta really is on a highway to creating the real-life
          matrix.'
        p2: In all honesty, I think the primary reason for backlash against the metaverse
          was that people didn’t really understand what it was or what it was intended
          to do. At its core, the Metaverse is more of a concept than a select product.
          The idea is based on the fact that over time our lives have become exponentially
          digitised. For example, a decade ago social media didn’t go beyond communicating
          with people you had already met in real life. Nowadays, a large proportion
          of the people we meet, we meet on social media.
        p3: Therefore, if this trend continues, it logically follows that our entire
          lives will occur online. This is the purpose of the Metaverse. It seeks
          to be the sole place that we work, the sole place that we relax, and the
          sole place that we really exist. In the long run, this technology will likely
          be combined with some form of automated life support technology that allows
          us to exist without needing to consider our physical existence at all.
        p4: 'The problem lies in obvious question that this poses: What will stop
          this from turning into the matrix? The answer is simply not much. However,
          I don’t think that this will stop the adoption of this technology. For example,
          it is common knowledge how digital advertising tools from social media platforms
          have been, and likely will continue to be, abused to manipulate public opinion
          for nefarious purposes such as electoral manipulation. People continue to
          use these platforms regardless.'
        p5: The point is that everyone understands that what these companies are doing
          is ultimately bad for everyone except those personally invested in the company.
          Again, the userbases of these companies continue to grow at a stable rate.
        p6: This is the root of the problem that we face. These companies, among many
          others, prove that if a product is appealing enough in the short-term, people
          will use it even if they know it will do massive damage to them in the long
          term.
        p7: A good example of this are things like gambling, pornography, and fast
          food. Each extremely profitable industries that exist due to their ability
          to hijack the human brain’s reward pathways. For example, gambling hijacks
          the human risk-reward pathways that were designed to make humans take the
          risks required for the species to progress. If early humans discovered a
          new plant, the only way to find out if it was safe to eat would be to try.
          If one population contained individuals that wouldn’t try anything new and
          another contained individuals that would occasionally try something new,
          the population that tried new things would gain a significant evolutionary
          advantage. This is also the basis for curiosity.
        p8: However, this system was refined in a world that looked very different
          to ours. We as humans (sadly, in only the majority of cases) are not scavenging
          for any food that is available on a day-to-day basis. This means that this
          system no longer makes sense. However, we have not been in this position
          for long enough for this to have evolved away. Therefore, we are left susceptible
          to exploitation through it.
        p9: This is the same mechanism by which we will be susceptible to the metaverse.
          If the metaverse can offer us an illusion of everything we could ever imagine,
          our reward systems will once again be hijacked because as far as our reward
          pathways are concerned, literal paradise is available to us if only we remain
          plugged into the headset. Even if we know it’s fake. Even if we know it’s
          bad for us. We just won’t be able to stop.
