    pool: 1
    pragmas:
        analysis_limit: 0           # Retained: No query analysis limit, minimal impact on concurrency
        auto_vacuum: 'INCREMENTAL'  # Changed: Enable automatic space reclamation without full vacuum locks
        automatic_index: 1          # Retained: Supports query performance, aids read concurrency
        busy_timeout: 5000          # Changed: Set to 5000 ms to handle lock contention for writers
        cache_size: -200000         # Retained: Large cache for performance, indirectly aids concurrency
        cache_spill: 1              # Retained: Enables cache spilling, performance optimization
        cell_size_check: 1          # Changed: Enable cell size checking for data integrity
        checkpoint_fullfsync: 1     # Changed: Enable full fsync for checkpoint integrity
        foreign_keys: 1             # Retained: Enforces foreign keys as requested
        fullfsync: 1                # Changed: Enable full fsync for maximum data integrity on macOS
        journal_mode: 'WAL'         # Changed: Enables WAL for high concurrency (multiple readers, one writer)
        journal_size_limit: -1      # Retained: Unlimited WAL size, monitor if growth is excessive
        locking_mode: 'NORMAL'      # Retained: Compatible with WAL, supports concurrency
        mmap_size: 200000000        # Retained: Large memory mapping for performance
        page_size: 16384            # Retained: Optimized page size for modern systems
        secure_delete: 'ON'         # Retained: Secure deletion as requested, minimal concurrency impact
        synchronous: 3              # Changed: Set to FULL for maximum data integrity and durability
        temp_store: 2               # Retained: Memory-based temp storage, reduces I/O
        optimize: 1048578           # Retained: Custom optimization, likely for query performance
        wal_autocheckpoint: 1000    # Automatic WAL checkpointing enabled
