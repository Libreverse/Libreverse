# Session and Cookies Configuration
# This file contains all session and cookie-related configurations including:
# - Cookie serialization
# - Session security
# - Parameter filtering for logging

# ===== Cookie Serialization =====
# Specify a serializer for the signed and encrypted cookie jars.
# Valid options are:
# - :json (safest, but can only serialize basic data types)
# - :marshal (most compatible, but potentially dangerous)
# - :hybrid (fallback mechanism that reads marshal cookies but writes json cookies)
#
# Using :json is the most secure option as it limits the risk of deserialization attacks
# that could occur with :marshal.
Rails.application.config.action_dispatch.cookies_serializer = :json

# Use SHA256 for signed cookies for improved security over the default SHA1
Rails.application.config.action_dispatch.signed_cookie_digest = "SHA256"

# Do not allow JavaScript to access cookies for added security
Rails.application.config.action_dispatch.cookies_same_site_protection = :strict

# Reduce session timeout from 12 hours to 2 hours for better security
Rails.application.config.session_store :active_record_store,
                                       key: "_libreverse_session",
                                       secure: Rails.env.production?,
                                       httponly: true,
                                       expire_after: 2.hours,
                                       same_site: :strict

# Force session rotation on privilege change events
Rails.application.config.to_prepare do
  Rodauth::Rails.app.opts[:after_login] = proc do
    request.env["action_dispatch.cookies"].rotate
  end

  Rodauth::Rails.app.opts[:after_password_change] = proc do
    request.env["action_dispatch.cookies"].rotate
  end

  Rodauth::Rails.app.opts[:after_change_login] = proc do
    request.env["action_dispatch.cookies"].rotate
  end
end

# ===== Parameter Filtering =====
# Configure parameters to be partially matched (e.g. passw matches password) and filtered from the log file.
# Use this to limit dissemination of sensitive information.
# See the ActiveSupport::ParameterFilter documentation for supported notations and behaviors.
Rails.application.config.filter_parameters += %i[
  # Credentials and authentication
