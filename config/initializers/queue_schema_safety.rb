# Test/schema load safety shim: avoid FK constraint errors when loading db/queue_schema.rb
# without modifying the auto-generated queue_schema file itself.
#
# Problem: queue_schema.rb (for the queue database) currently contains a full copy of core tables
# (accounts, experiences, etc.). When Rails loads schemas for multiple databases, it attempts to
# drop and recreate those tables with force: :cascade. MySQL/TiDB refuses to drop a parent table
# referenced by foreign keys from still-present child tables, causing test boot to abort.
#
# Approach: During the loading of db/queue_schema.rb only, intercept create_table calls targeting
# known core tables that already exist and strip the :force option so we do NOT drop them. This
# is minimally invasive, does not alter generated schema files, and is test-safe.
#
# The patch is scoped by inspecting the Ruby call stack for 'db/queue_schema.rb'. If that file is
# not on the stack we fall through to the normal create_table behavior.
#
# NOTE: Keep the duplicate table list conservative; adding a table here simply prevents an
# unnecessary drop/recreate cycle if it already exists.
