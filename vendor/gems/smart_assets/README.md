# SmartAssets (vendored for Rails 8.1)

This is a vendored copy of [zarqman/smart_assets](https://github.com/zarqman/smart_assets) version 1.2.0 with a relaxed Rails dependency (`< 8.2`) to allow usage on Rails 8.1.x.

Upstream summary: Rack middleware that rewrites non-digest asset requests to their digested counterparts using the Sprockets manifest, adding short cache headers.
