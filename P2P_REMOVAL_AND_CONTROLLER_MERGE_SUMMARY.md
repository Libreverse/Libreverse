- ✅ Added utility methods for child controllers (showToast, updateTheme, etc.)
- ✅ Kept original StimulusReflex functionality

#### `glass_controller.coffee`
- ✅ Added stimulus-store integration
- ✅ Added global glass config listening
- ✅ Added force enable/disable options
- ✅ Added store change handlers for reactive updates
- ✅ Kept all original glass rendering functionality

#### `toast_controller.coffee`
- ✅ Added stimulus-store integration
- ✅ Added enhanced animation and progress bar support
- ✅ Added pause/resume functionality on hover
- ✅ Added keyboard support and accessibility
- ✅ Added centralized toast management

#### `instance_settings_controller.coffee`
- ✅ Added stimulus-store integration
- ✅ Added auto-save functionality with debouncing
- ✅ Added optimistic UI updates
- ✅ Added form state tracking (dirty/loading states)
- ✅ Kept all original StimulusReflex methods

#### `search_controller.coffee` (New)

- ✅ Added stimulus-store integration
- ✅ Added debounced search with configurable delay
- ✅ Added filter management and pagination
- ✅ Added URL synchronization
- ✅ Kept original StimulusReflex search functionality

**Removed Enhanced Controller Files:**
- `/app/javascript/controllers/enhanced_application_controller.coffee`
- `/app/javascript/controllers/enhanced_glass_controller.coffee`
- `/app/javascript/controllers/enhanced_toast_controller.coffee`
- `/app/javascript/controllers/enhanced_instance_settings_controller.coffee`
- `/app/javascript/controllers/enhanced_search_controller.coffee`

**Updated Controller Index:**
- `app/javascript/controllers/index.js` - Removed enhanced controller registrations, added search controller

### 3. Documentation Updates ✅

**Updated Files:**
- `documentation/stimulus_store_implementation_summary.md` - Updated to reflect merged functionality
- `documentation/stimulus_store_migration.md` - Removed P2P references

## Key Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Cleaner Codebase**
- No duplicate "enhanced" vs "main" controllers
- Single source of truth for each controller
- Eliminated confusion about which controller to use

### 2. **Preserved All Functionality** 
- All original controller functionality retained
- All enhanced store integration features preserved
- All StimulusReflex functionality intact
- Backward compatibility maintained

### 3. **Improved Developer Experience**
- No need to decide between enhanced vs regular controllers
- All controllers now have store integration by default
- Consistent API across all controllers

### 4. **Removed Technical Debt**
- Eliminated unused P2P system
- Simplified multiplayer experience rendering
- Removed dead code and references

## Current State

✅ **All controllers now have stimulus-store integration built-in**
✅ **P2P system completely removed**
✅ **No build errors or syntax issues**
✅ **Rails application loads successfully**
✅ **Dependencies updated (bun.lock regenerated)**

## Next Steps for Developer

1. **Test the merged controllers** in your application
2. **Update any custom HTML templates** that reference enhanced controllers (if any)
3. **Verify toast notifications** work with the enhanced functionality
4. **Test search functionality** with the new integrated search controller
5. **Check glass effects** respond to global configuration changes

The codebase is now cleaner, more maintainable, and has all the enhanced functionality merged into the main controllers without any separate "enhanced" versions.
