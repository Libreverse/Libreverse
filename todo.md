# Todo

revamp the p2p api using yjs
also weigh up the architecture of yjs stateful, webrtc stateless and local stores for data.
make container runtime using docker in docker
fix glass not scrolling as it should
integrate the rodauth complex multi-db account features
finish blog and social features (i.e blog posts as an AP post that then are replied to with linked mastodon accounts) will require us to ship a prebuilt blocklist. Of course, this comes with censorship concerns
deploy without master_key being pre-set - pretty much as simple as removing the creds.yml.enc file
deploy with ssl without a reverse proxy - easy to do now with nginx but the current cloud setup makes this not a logical choice.
release beta
add in premade bad stuff blocklist for federation
add full decentralisation mode where blockchain nodes are used to make the index for decentraland and the sandbox and others
Release v3 gamma
Add telegram search bot
Add x.com search bot
