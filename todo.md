# Todo List

## CoffeeScript ESLint Integration Tasks

- [x] Convert existing CoffeeScript files from ES6 import/export to CommonJS require() syntax
- [x] Add Jest plugin back (downgrade to 2021 version compatible with ESLint 7.x)
- [x] Add Unicorn plugin back (downgrade to 2021 version compatible with ESLint 7.x)
- [x] Migrate from coffeelint to eslint-plugin-coffee styling rules
- [ ] Add eslint-config-prettier for rule conflict managment between eslint and prettier (we don't want the prettier plugin because prettier formats more than js for us)
- [ ] Add CoffeeScript Prettier integration (prettier-plugin-coffeescript)
- [ ] Configure eslint-config-prettier to disable conflicting rules
- [ ] Test and validate the complete CoffeeScript linting setup
- [ ] Update project scripts to use eslint instead of coffeelint for CoffeeScript files
