# Todo List

The plan:
Use the docker-api gem and docker socket sharing to allow the app to create containers from a compose file

use <https://gitlab.com/manyfold3d/federails> for handling discovery

make it so that docker containers can be orchestrated allowing for experiences to be built however desired

The idea is essentially users post experiences which is code that connects in any chosen way to the webserver.

Use indieauth through authorio-updated

set up vector search in postgres using pgvector

increase the scope of dockerignore

fix csp
