bring in worker killer

```ruby

killer = WorkerKiller::Killer::Passenger.new

middleware.insert_before(
  Rack::Runtime,
  WorkerKiller::Middleware::OOMLimiter,
  killer: killer,
  min: 2_516_582_400, # 2.4GB in bytes
  max: 2_724_659_200, # 2.6GB in bytes
  check_cycle: 16     # check every 16 requests (default is fine)
)
```
