# Todo List

The plan:

Use rodauth-rails to allow us to have secure auth

Use rel="me" links to allow users to demonstrate interlinkage between accounts. When two rel="me" links point to each other, the accounts must be controlled by the same person

Use existing search engine theory to allow for cross-instance discovery
set up vector search in postgres using pgvector

from there, simply let instance admins add experiences by directly editing instance code before building and deploying

increase the scope of dockerignore

fix csp
