# To-do

- [ ] Fix glass not scrolling as it should
- [ ] Integrate the rodauth complex multi-db account features
- [ ] Finish blog & social features (blog posts as ActivityPub posts; ship prebuilt blocklist & document censorship considerations)
- [ ] Deploy without master_key pre-set (remove `credentials.yml.enc` handling adjustments)
- [ ] Deploy with SSL without reverse proxy (evaluate direct nginx inside container viability vs current cloud setup)
- [] Add container runtime using podman in docker

- [ ] Release beta
- [ ] Add premade "bad content" federation blocklist
- [ ] Add full decentralisation mode (blockchain-backed index for Decentraland, The Sandbox, etc.)
- [ ] Release v3 gamma
- [ ] Add Telegram search bot
- [ ] Add x.com search bot
