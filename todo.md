# Todo List

1: Add email search bot
2: Add telegram search bot
3: Add x.com search bot
4: Open gRPC port on libreverse.geor.me
5: Figure out how to a: deploy without master_key being pre-set and b: deploy with ssl without a reverse proxy
5: Migrate to libreverse.io for beta release which is probably just a final audit or two away
