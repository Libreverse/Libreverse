                On October 28, 2021, Mark Zuckerberg had become the laughing
                stock of the internet after rebranding Facebook to Meta Platforms
                as part of his efforts to create an online Metaverse. Three years
                later, it's looking increasingly like the internet is becoming
                the laughing stock of Mark Zuckerberg, as the Metaverse grows
                ever closer to reality.
