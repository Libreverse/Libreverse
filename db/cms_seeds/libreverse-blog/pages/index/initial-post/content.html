<p class="lead">
    We're thrilled to announce the launch of the official Libreverse blog! This
    marks an important milestone in our journey to create a more
    privacy-focused, user-centric social platform.
</p>

<h2>What is Libreverse?</h2>
<p>
    Libreverse is a revolutionary social platform that puts
    <strong>your privacy and control</strong> at the center of the experience.
    Unlike traditional social media platforms that profit from your data,
    Libreverse is built on the principles of:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Privacy by Design</strong> - Your data belongs to you, not us
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>User Empowerment</strong> - You control what you share and with
        whom
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Meaningful Connections</strong> - Quality over quantity in
        social interactions
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Transparency</strong> - Open-source development and clear
        policies
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>What to Expect from This Blog</h2>
