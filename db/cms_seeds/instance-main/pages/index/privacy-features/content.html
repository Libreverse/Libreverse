<p class="lead">In an era where data privacy is increasingly important, Libreverse stands apart by implementing privacy-first design principles. Let's explore the features that make your data truly yours.</p>

<h2>üîí Privacy by Design</h2>
<p>Unlike platforms that retrofit privacy features as an afterthought, Libreverse was built from the ground up with privacy as a core principle. Every feature, every decision, and every line of code considers your privacy first.</p>

<h2>Key Privacy Features</h2>

<h3>1. Granular Privacy Controls</h3>
<p>You have complete control over who sees your content:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Public</strong> - Visible to everyone, including search engines</li>
  <li><strong>Unlisted</strong> - Accessible via direct link but not searchable</li>
  <li><strong>Community Only</strong> - Visible only to registered Libreverse users</li>
  <li><strong>Private</strong> - Only visible to you</li>
  <li><strong>Custom Groups</strong> - Share with specific people you choose</li>
</ul>
