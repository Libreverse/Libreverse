# Litestream Integration Summary

## ✅ Complete Integration Successfully Implemented

The Litestream database replication system has been fully integrated into LibReverse with the following components:

### 🔧 Configuration Files

1. **`config/litestream.yml`** - Main Litestream configuration
    - Configured for production database at `/data/production.sqlite3`
    - Configured for development database at `db/libreverse_development.sqlite3`
    - Uses environment variables for all sensitive credentials

2. **`config/initializers/litestream.rb`** - Gem configuration
    - Sets up required environment variables
    - Configures admin dashboard authentication
    - Validates configuration on startup

3. **`config/initializers/litestream_in_process.rb`** - Process management
    - Automatically starts Litestream as a separate process
    - Manages process lifecycle (startup/shutdown)
    - Includes environment variable validation

4. **`Procfile.dev`** - Development process definition
    - Added Litestream to development environment
    - Runs alongside Rails, Vite, and MailHog

### 🎛️ Admin Dashboard Integration

1. **`app/controllers/admin/litestream_controller.rb`** - Admin controller
    - Provides API endpoints for database info
    - Handles backup verification
    - Secured with admin authentication

2. **`app/views/admin/litestream/index.haml`** - Admin dashboard view
    - Shows replication status
    - Lists configured databases
    - Provides backup verification
    - Links to full Litestream dashboard

3. **`app/javascript/controllers/admin_litestream_controller.coffee`** - Frontend interactions
    - Handles modal dialogs
    - Makes API calls for data
    - Provides user feedback

4. **Routes integration** - Added to admin routes
    - `/admin/litestream` - Main dashboard
    - `/admin/litestream/dashboard` - Full Litestream dashboard
    - API endpoints for database operations

### 🔐 Required Environment Variables

The following environment variables **must** be set for Litestream to function:

```bash
# Required - Application CRASHES in production if missing
LITESTREAM_REPLICA_BUCKET=your-s3-bucket-name
LITESTREAM_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
LITESTREAM_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key

# Optional (with defaults)
LITESTREAM_REPLICA_REGION=us-east-1
LITESTREAM_REPLICA_ENDPOINT=https://s3.amazonaws.com
```

**🚨 Critical Production Requirement**: The application will crash on startup in production if the required environment variables are missing. This ensures database durability is never compromised due to misconfiguration.

### 🏃‍♂️ Process Management

**Production:**

- Litestream starts automatically with the Rails application
- Runs as a separate forked process
- Manages its own lifecycle
- No manual intervention required

**Development:**

- Added to `Procfile.dev` for `foreman start`
- Can be tested with local MinIO instance
- Graceful startup/shutdown with Rails server

### 🛡️ Security Features

1. **Fail-Fast Production Deployment** - Application crashes on startup if required environment variables are missing in production, ensuring database durability is never compromised

2. **Environment Variable Requirement** - Unlike other LibReverse features, Litestream requires explicit environment variables for security compliance

3. **Admin Authentication** - Dashboard access requires admin privileges through existing LibReverse admin system

4. **Process Isolation** - Runs as separate process to avoid blocking main application

### 📊 Monitoring & Operations

**Admin Dashboard provides:**

- Configuration status (environment variables check)
- Process status (whether Litestream is running)
- Database listing with backup information
- Backup verification functionality
- Access to full Litestream web dashboard

**Command Line Operations:**

```bash
# View configured databases
rails litestream:databases

# Restore a database
rails litestream:restore -- --database=/data/production.sqlite3

# Verify backup integrity
rails runner "Litestream.verify!('/data/production.sqlite3')"
```

### 🔍 Status Verification

✅ **Rails Application**: Loads successfully with all integrations
✅ **Route Configuration**: All admin routes properly configured  
✅ **Process Management**: Litestream initializer correctly detects environment
✅ **Admin Navigation**: Litestream link added to admin layout
✅ **Documentation**: Complete documentation created

### 🚀 Next Steps for Production

1. **Set Environment Variables**: Configure the required Litestream environment variables in your production environment

2. **Test Backup/Restore**: Verify the backup and restore process works with your S3 storage

3. **Monitor Dashboard**: Access `/admin/litestream` to monitor replication status

4. **Optional Dashboard Auth**: Set Litestream username/password in Rails credentials for additional security

### 📁 Files Created/Modified

**New files:**

- `config/initializers/litestream_in_process.rb`
- `app/controllers/admin/litestream_controller.rb`
- `app/views/admin/litestream/index.haml`
- `app/javascript/controllers/admin_litestream_controller.coffee`
- `documentation/litestream_integration.md`

**Modified files:**

- `config/litestream.yml` - Updated paths and configuration
- `config/initializers/litestream.rb` - Added admin authentication
- `config/routes.rb` - Added admin routes
- `app/views/layouts/admin.haml` - Added navigation link
- `Procfile.dev` - Added Litestream process
- `config/cache.yml` - Fixed YAML syntax issue

The integration follows LibReverse's existing patterns for process management (similar to Solid Queue) and admin interface design, ensuring consistency with the rest of the application.
