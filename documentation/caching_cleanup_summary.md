# Caching Cleanup Summary

## Controllers Cleaned Up

### ✅ Removed Redundant Manual Caching

**DashboardController:**

- Removed `set_cache_headers_for_dashboard` method
- Removed `set_dashboard_caching` method
- Now uses automatic large response caching (5 minutes private for authenticated users)

**SearchController:**

- Removed `set_cache_headers_for_search` method
- Removed `set_search_caching` method
- Now uses automatic medium response caching (2 minutes private for authenticated users)

**PoliciesController:**

- Removed `set_cache_headers` method
- Removed `before_action :set_cache_headers`
- Now uses automatic medium response caching (10 minutes public for unauthenticated)

**ExperiencesController:**

- Removed `set_cache_headers_for_index` method
- Removed `before_action :set_cache_headers_for_index`
- Now uses automatic medium response caching

### ✅ Kept Custom Caching (Strategic Decisions)

**RobotsController:**

- Kept custom turbocache headers with extended `stale-while-revalidate=3600`
- Kept Last-Modified header based on InstanceSetting changes
- More optimal than default automatic caching for this specific use case

**WellKnownController:**

- Kept 1-day cache duration for security.txt and privacy.txt
- Files change very infrequently, so longer cache is beneficial
- Better than default 2-second turbocache for these static files

**API Controllers (xmlrpc, json, grpc, graphql):**

- Kept explicit `set_no_cache_headers`
- API responses often contain sensitive or dynamic data
- Explicit no-cache is safer than relying on automatic detection

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Reduced Code Duplication:** Removed ~50 lines of redundant caching code
2. **Consistent Behavior:** All controllers now use the same intelligent caching system
3. **Easier Maintenance:** Central configuration instead of scattered cache settings
4. **Better Defaults:** Automatic system provides better cache strategies than manual ones
5. **Strategic Exceptions:** Kept custom caching only where it provides specific benefits

## Automatic Caching Now Handles

- **Dashboard:** Large response caching (5min private) + enhanced ETags
- **Search:** Medium response caching (2min private) + enhanced ETags
- **Policies:** Medium response caching (10min public)
- **Experiences:** Medium response caching based on authentication status
- **All Other Controllers:** Appropriate caching based on response size and authentication

## Controllers with Custom Caching Remaining

1. **RobotsController:** Turbocache + 1-hour stale-while-revalidate
2. **WellKnownController:** 1-day public cache for static files
3. **API Controllers:** Explicit no-cache for security
4. **Any controller that calls `skip_automatic_caching!`**
