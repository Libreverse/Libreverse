# Experiences

## Overview

Experiences are the core content type in Libreverse. They represent interactive digital environments that users can create, share, and explore. This documentation covers how experiences are structured, managed, and interacted with in the platform.

## Experience Structure

Each experience in Libreverse consists of the following components:

- **Title**: A descriptive name for the experience
- **Description**: A brief summary explaining what the experience offers
- **Author**: The creator of the experience
- **Content**: The main content of the experience, which can include text, code, and multimedia elements
- **Creation Date**: When the experience was first created
- **Last Update**: When the experience was last modified

## Experience Management

### Creating Experiences

Authenticated users can create new experiences through a dedicated experience editor interface. The creation process includes:

1. Entering basic metadata (title, description)
2. Building the experience content using the provided tools
3. Publishing the experience to make it available to other users

### Editing Experiences

Creators can modify their experiences at any time:

- Update any metadata
- Revise content
- Unpublish or republish as needed

### Experience Lifecycle

Experiences go through several states:

- **Draft**: In-progress, not yet published
- **Published**: Live and available to other users
- **Archived**: No longer actively maintained but still accessible
- **Removed**: Hidden from general access

## Accessing Experiences

Users can access experiences through multiple entry points:

- **Search**: Finding experiences based on keywords, tags, or author
- **Featured Gallery**: Highlighted experiences on the dashboard
- **Direct Links**: Sharing links to specific experiences
- **API**: Programmatic access via the XML-RPC API

## Interaction Capabilities

When viewing an experience, users can:

- **Navigate**: Explore the experience environment
- **Comment**: Leave feedback for creators (if enabled)
- **Share**: Generate links to share with others
- **Save**: Bookmark experiences for later access (authenticated users only)

## Technical Implementation

Experiences are implemented using:

- The `Experience` model for data structure and persistence
- The `ExperiencesController` for CRUD operations
- Associated views for rendering and interaction
- Background processing for optimization of media content

### Data Model

The Experience model includes:

```ruby
# Core fields
title       # String: The name of the experience
description # Text: Detailed description
author      # String: Creator attribution
content     # Text: Main content (supports rich formatting)

# Metadata
created_at  # DateTime: Creation timestamp
updated_at  # DateTime: Last update timestamp
```

### API Access

Experiences can be programmatically accessed via the XML-RPC API, with methods including:

- `experiences.all`: Retrieve all available experiences
- `experiences.get`: Retrieve a specific experience by ID

## Best Practices

### For Creators

- Use descriptive titles that clearly communicate the experience content
- Provide thorough descriptions for better discoverability
- Regularly update experiences to keep content fresh
- Test experiences across different devices for compatibility

### For Developers

- Access experiences via the API for integration with external applications
- Follow rate limiting guidelines to ensure system stability
- Cache experience data appropriately for performance
