## 📚 Browse the docs

Use the sidebar to navigate all available guides and references. It’s the single source of truth for the current documentation set.

## ✍️ Authoring guidelines

To keep this corpus useful:

- Write actionable documentation (guides, specs, how-tos). Avoid change logs, status updates, or summaries without instructions.
- Prefer one topic per file, with a short “Overview”, “How it works”, and “How to use” structure.
- Include minimal, runnable examples when describing APIs or CLIs.
- Keep names descriptive and consistent; use lowercase-with-hyphens for new filenames.

## 🔄 Updating documentation

When updating docs:

- Ensure accuracy and keep examples current.
- Use consistent terminology.
- Link to related docs to help readers discover context.
- If removing outdated content, replace it with a pointer to the canonical document or delete it outright (don’t keep status-only notes).
