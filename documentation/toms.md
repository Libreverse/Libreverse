# Technical & Organisational Measures (TOMs)

This document outlines the technical and organisational measures implemented to ensure the security and integrity of the Libreverse platform. These measures are designed to protect user data, maintain service availability, and comply with relevant legal and regulatory requirements.

## 1. Encryption

**At Rest:**

- Sensitive data (including authentication credentials and PII) is encrypted at rest using strong, industry-standard algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
- Database-level encryption is enabled for critical tables and columns, including those managed by authentication and user management systems.
- File storage (e.g., user uploads, backups) is encrypted using storage provider encryption or OS-level disk encryption.

**In Transit:**

- All data transmitted between clients and the platform is encrypted using TLS (HTTPS) with modern cipher suites.
- Internal service communication (e.g., between app servers, background jobs, and databases) is secured using TLS where supported.

## 2. Access Controls

- Role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced throughout the application, ensuring users can only access resources appropriate to their role.
- Administrative interfaces are protected by strong authentication and, where possible, additional access restrictions (e.g., IP allowlisting).
- Sensitive actions (e.g., account deletion, privilege escalation) require re-authentication or multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Principle of least privilege is applied to all system accounts and API keys.
- Access to production infrastructure is restricted to authorized personnel and protected by SSH key authentication and/or SSO.

## 3. Backups

- Automated, regular backups are performed for all critical databases and file storage.
- Backups are encrypted at rest and stored in geographically redundant locations.
- Backup integrity is regularly tested through restore drills and checksum verification.
- Access to backup data is strictly limited and logged.
- Backup retention policies are defined to comply with legal and business requirements.

## 4. Additional Measures

_This section will be expanded as further TOMs are implemented, including but not limited to:_

- Logging and monitoring
- Incident response
- Data minimization
- Secure software development lifecycle (SDLC)
- Vendor risk management
