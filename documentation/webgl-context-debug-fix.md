# WebGL Context Issues - Debug and Fix Summary

## Issues Identified from Logs

### 1. **Import Error in Monitor**

```javascript
webgl_context_monitor.js:40 Uncaught ReferenceError: optimizedWebGLContextManager is not defined
```

**Fixed:** Added proper import statement and error handling

### 2. **Scroll-Dependent Initialization**

Glass effects only loaded after scrolling due to intersection observer waiting for visibility.

**Fixed:**

- Added immediate visibility check for already-visible elements
- Increased root margin to 100px for earlier detection
- Added timeout-based fallback for immediate initialization

### 3. **Context Warnings Still Occurring**

```javascript
WARNING: Too many active WebGL contexts. Oldest context will be lost.
```

**Fixed:**

- Reduced max contexts from 12 to 8
- Reduced max containers from 12 to 8
- Reduced active rendering instances from 8 to 6
- More aggressive cleanup every 3 seconds (was 5)
- Added double-check before context creation

## New Configuration

### WebGL Context Manager

```javascript
maxContexts: 8; // was 12
maxPoolSize: 4; // was 6
cleanupInterval: 3000; // was 5000ms
```

### Container Limits

```javascript
maxConcurrentInstances: 8; // was 12
maxActiveRenderingInstances: 6; // was 8
```

### Monitor Thresholds

```javascript
warningThreshold: 6; // was 8
criticalThreshold: 8; // was 10
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Immediate Loading**: Glass effects should load immediately without requiring scroll
2. **No Context Warnings**: Should stay well under browser limits
3. **Better Performance**: Fewer active contexts reduces GPU load
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Emergency systems activate if limits approached

## Monitoring Commands

```javascript
// Check current status
Container.getStats();
webglDashboard.show(); // Visual dashboard

// Emergency cleanup if needed
optimizedWebGLContextManager.aggressiveCleanup();
```

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. **Check browser DevTools** for WebGL-related errors
2. **Monitor creation rate** - should be < 3 contexts/second
3. **Verify visibility detection** - containers should initialize immediately if visible
4. **Use dashboard** (Ctrl+Shift+W) to monitor real-time stats

The system is now much more conservative and should prevent context overloading while maintaining visual quality.
