# Rolify & CanCanCan Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation successfully integrates Rolify and CanCanCan to solve the issue where guest accounts were being treated as fully authenticated users. The system now properly distinguishes between different types of users based on roles.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Gem Installation**

- Added `rolify` and `cancancan` to Gemfile
- Generated Role model and migration
- Created CanCanCan Ability class

### 2. **Role-Based User Types**

The system now recognizes 4 distinct user types:

1. **Anonymous Users** - No account, not logged in
2. **Guest Users** - Logged in with a guest account (has `:guest` role)
3. **Authenticated Users** - Logged in with a regular account (has `:user` role)
4. **Admin Users** - Authenticated users with admin privileges (has `:admin` role)

### 3. **Account Model Enhancements**

Added to `/app/models/account.rb`:

- `rolify` integration
- Role assignment methods (`assign_default_role`)
- Enhanced authentication helpers (`authenticated_user?`, `effective_user?`)
- Automatic role assignment on account creation/update

### 4. **Authorization System**

Created `/app/models/ability.rb` with:

- Role-based permissions for different user types
- Experience-specific permissions
- Admin access controls

### 5. **Controller Integration**

Updated `/app/controllers/application_controller.rb`:

- CanCanCan integration
- New authentication helper methods
- Authorization error handling

### 6. **Data Migration**

Created migration to assign roles to existing accounts based on their guest status.

## Key Methods & Usage

### Authentication Helpers (Available in Controllers & Views)

```ruby
# Basic authentication
user_signed_in?           # Any logged in user (including guests)
authenticated_user?       # Non-guest users only
guest_user?              # Guest users only
can_create_content?       # Users who can create content

# Current user
current_account          # The logged in account (or nil)
current_ability          # CanCanCan ability for current user
```

### Controller Protection

```ruby
class MyController < ApplicationController
  # Require any logged in user (including guests)
  before_action :require_authentication

  # Require non-guest users only
  before_action :require_authenticated_user

  # Require non-guest users for specific actions
  before_action :require_non_guest, only: [:create, :update]

  # CanCanCan authorization
  load_and_authorize_resource
  authorize_resource class: false  # For non-model resources
end
```

### View Usage

```erb
<% if authenticated_user? %>
  <!-- Content for real users -->
  <%= link_to "Create Experience", new_experience_path %>
<% elsif guest_user? %>
  <!-- Content for guest users -->
  <p>Please upgrade to a full account to create content.</p>
<% else %>
  <!-- Content for anonymous users -->
  <%= link_to "Sign Up", signup_path %>
<% end %>

<!-- CanCanCan permissions -->
<% if can? :create, Experience %>
  <%= link_to "New Experience", new_experience_path %>
<% end %>
```

## Permissions Matrix

| User Type | Read Content | Create Content | Admin Area | Own Account |
| --------- | ------------ | -------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Anonymous | Public only  | Account only   | ‚ùå         | ‚ùå          |
| Guest     | ‚úÖ           | ‚ùå             | ‚ùå         | Limited     |
| User      | ‚úÖ           | ‚úÖ             | ‚ùå         | ‚úÖ          |
| Admin     | ‚úÖ           | ‚úÖ             | ‚úÖ         | ‚úÖ          |

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files

- `/app/models/role.rb` - Rolify Role model
- `/app/models/ability.rb` - CanCanCan authorization rules
- `/config/initializers/cancancan.rb` - Authorization error handling
- `/db/migrate/*_rolify_create_roles.rb` - Roles table migration
- `/db/migrate/*_assign_initial_roles_to_accounts.rb` - Role assignment migration
- `/scripts/test_auth_integration.rb` - Integration test script

### Modified Files

- `/Gemfile` - Added rolify and cancancan gems
- `/app/models/account.rb` - Added rolify and role methods
- `/app/controllers/application_controller.rb` - Added CanCanCan integration
- `/app/controllers/experiences_controller.rb` - Example of using new authorization

## Testing

Run the integration test to verify everything is working:

```bash
ruby scripts/test_auth_integration.rb
```

Expected output:

- ‚úì Rolify integration working
- ‚úì Role assignment working
- ‚úì Authentication helpers working
- ‚úì CanCanCan abilities working

## Migration Instructions

### For Existing Accounts

The migration automatically assigned roles to existing accounts:

- Guest accounts (where `guest = true`) ‚Üí `:guest` role
- Regular accounts (where `guest = false`) ‚Üí `:user` role
- Admin accounts (where `admin = true`) ‚Üí `:admin` role

### For New Accounts

Roles are automatically assigned via callbacks:

- `after_create :assign_default_role`
- `after_update :assign_default_role, if: :saved_change_to_guest?`

## Example Controller Update

```ruby
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  # Use CanCanCan for authorization
  load_and_authorize_resource

  # Require authenticated users for content creation
  before_action :require_authenticated_user, only: [:new, :create, :edit, :update, :destroy]

  def index
    # @posts automatically loaded and authorized by CanCanCan
    # Guests can view, but not create
  end

  def create
    # Only non-guest users can reach this action
    # @post automatically authorized by CanCanCan
  end
end
```

## Benefits

1. **Clear User Type Distinction** - No more confusion between guest and real users
2. **Granular Permissions** - Different capabilities for different user types
3. **Secure by Default** - Guests can't perform privileged actions
4. **Maintainable** - Centralized authorization logic in Ability class
5. **Flexible** - Easy to add new roles and permissions as needed

## Next Steps

1. Update other controllers to use the new authorization system
2. Update views to show appropriate content based on user roles
3. Consider adding more specific roles (e.g., `:moderator`, `:editor`)
4. Add role-based navigation menus
5. Implement role management UI for admins

The integration is now complete and working correctly! üöÄ
