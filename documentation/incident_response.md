# Incident Response Plan

## Introduction

This document outlines the procedures to follow in the event of a security incident. The goal is to effectively manage the incident, minimize its impact, and restore normal operations as quickly as possible.

## Roles and Responsibilities

- **Incident Commander (IC)**: Overall authority and decision-maker during an incident. Responsible for coordinating all response efforts. (Typically a senior engineering lead or manager).
- **Technical Lead (TL)**: Deep technical expertise, responsible for guiding the technical investigation, containment, eradication, and recovery. (Typically a senior developer or operations engineer).
- **Communications Lead (CL)**: Manages internal and external communications, including updates to stakeholders, users (if necessary), and media (if necessary). (Typically someone from marketing, PR, or a designated spokesperson).
- **Security Analyst(s)**: Investigate the incident, gather evidence, and identify the attack vector and scope.
- **Legal Counsel**: Provides guidance on legal and regulatory obligations, particularly regarding data breaches and user notification.
- **Support Lead**: Coordinates customer support efforts and manages inquiries related to the incident.

## Incident Classification

Incidents are classified based on their severity and type to prioritize response efforts and resources.

### Severity Levels

- **Critical (Severity 1)**:
    - **Description**: Incidents that cause a complete outage of critical services, widespread data breach of sensitive information (PII, financial data), or pose an immediate threat to the platform's integrity or user safety. Significant legal, reputational, or financial impact.
    - **Examples**: Major DDoS attack rendering the site unusable, compromise of production database with user credentials, ransomware infection encrypting critical systems.
    - **Response**: Immediate, all-hands response required.
- **High (Severity 2)**:
    - **Description**: Incidents that cause significant degradation of critical services, partial data breach, or involve a serious security vulnerability with a high likelihood of exploitation. Potential for significant impact if not addressed quickly.
    - **Examples**: Exploited XSS vulnerability affecting a large number of users, partial service outage, loss of non-critical but important data.
    - **Response**: Urgent response required, mobilize relevant teams.
- **Medium (Severity 3)**:
    - **Description**: Incidents that cause minor service degradation, limited data exposure, or involve a moderate security vulnerability. Impact is limited but could escalate.
    - **Examples**: Minor bug affecting a non-critical feature, isolated malware infection on an internal system, discovery of a moderate vulnerability with no evidence of exploitation.
    - **Response**: Prompt response, address during business hours or by on-call personnel.
- **Low (Severity 4)**:
    - **Description**: Incidents with minimal impact, such as minor operational issues, low-risk vulnerabilities, or policy violations with no immediate threat.
    - **Examples**: Failed cron job with no user impact, discovery of a low-risk vulnerability, non-compliance with an internal security policy.
    - **Response**: Address as part of routine operations.

### Incident Types

- **Unauthorized Access**: Any access to systems, data, or applications by an unauthorized individual or process. (e.g., compromised accounts, breached servers).
- **Data Breach**: Unauthorized disclosure, modification, or destruction of sensitive, protected, or confidential data. (e.g., PII exposure, intellectual property theft).
- **Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)**: Attacks that overwhelm system resources, making services unavailable to legitimate users.
- **Malware Infection**: Presence of malicious software (viruses, worms, ransomware, spyware) on systems.
- **Phishing/Social Engineering**: Attempts to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information or performing actions.
- **Insider Threat**: Malicious or accidental actions by current or former employees, contractors, or partners that compromise security.
- **Vulnerability Exploitation**: Successful attack leveraging a known or unknown weakness in software, hardware, or configurations.
- **Physical Security Breach**: Unauthorized physical access to facilities, equipment, or documents.
- **Policy Violation**: Non-compliance with established security policies that could lead to a security risk.

## Incident Response Phases

1. **Preparation**: Proactive measures to prevent and prepare for incidents.
2. **Identification**: Detecting and confirming a security incident.
3. **Containment**: Limiting the scope and impact of the incident.
4. **Eradication**: Removing the cause of the incident.
5. **Recovery**: Restoring affected systems and services.
6. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review and improvement.

## Key Rotation Procedures

In the event of a compromise involving sensitive keys (e.g., API keys, database credentials, encryption keys), the following steps must be taken:

1. **Identify Compromised Keys**: Determine which keys were or may have been compromised.
2. **Generate New Keys**: Create new, strong, unique keys to replace the compromised ones.
3. **Deploy New Keys**: Securely distribute and deploy the new keys to all affected systems and services.
    - [Specify procedure for updating application configurations]
    - [Specify procedure for updating infrastructure components]
4. **Revoke Old Keys**: Immediately revoke or disable the compromised keys to prevent further unauthorized access.
    - [Specify procedure for revoking API keys with providers]
    - [Specify procedure for changing database passwords]
5. **Verify**: Confirm that all systems are using the new keys and that the old keys are no longer active.
6. **Monitor**: Closely monitor systems for any unusual activity after key rotation.

## User Notification Procedures

If a security incident involves a breach of user data or significantly impacts users, timely and transparent communication is crucial.

1. **Assess Impact**: Determine the scope of the breach and what user data was affected (e.g., PII, credentials).
2. **Legal and Regulatory Obligations**: Consult with legal counsel to understand notification requirements based on jurisdiction and data type (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
3. **Craft Notification Message**:
    - Clearly explain what happened in plain language.
    - Specify what information was involved.
    - Describe the steps being taken to address the incident.
    - Provide guidance to users on steps they can take to protect themselves (e.g., change passwords, monitor accounts).
    - Include contact information for support or further questions.
    - Do NOT include unnecessary technical jargon.
    - Do NOT speculate or provide unconfirmed information.
4. **Determine Notification Method**:
    - Direct email to affected users.
    - Prominent notice on the website/application.
    - Press release (for widespread incidents).
5. **Execute Notification**: Send out notifications according to the plan.
6. **Manage Inquiries**: Be prepared to handle user inquiries and provide support.
7. **Document**: Keep a record of all notification activities.

## Post-Incident Analysis (Lessons Learned)

After the incident is resolved:

1. **Conduct a Review**: Analyze the incident, the response, and the effectiveness of this plan.
2. **Identify Root Cause**: Determine the underlying cause of the incident.
3. **Update Plan**: Revise this incident response plan and related security measures based on lessons learned.
4. **Implement Improvements**: Take action to prevent similar incidents in the future.
