# Libreverse

Libreverse is a privacy‑centric application for curating and sharing interactive "experiences" (self‑contained HTML documents). Powered by Hotwire, it delivers a seamless, single‑page‑application (SPA) experience entirely within the Ruby on Rails ecosystem while keeping all of your data on your own machine.

> **Alpha release** – this version is under active development. Expect breaking changes, incomplete features, and occasional rough edges. Planned work is tracked in our [road‑map](todo.md).

## ✨ Key Features

- **Local‑first data management** – SQLite (via the enhanced adapter) provides generated columns, JSON queries, and full‑text search without a separate database server.
- **Real‑time UI** – Turbo, Stimulus, and StimulusReflex enable instantaneous updates with minimal client‑side JavaScript.
- **Secure account system** – [Rodauth](https://rodauth.dev/) with Argon2 hashing, email‑based login, remember‑me cookies, and optional guest mode.
- **Media attachments** – Active Storage with rigorous validations, encrypted blobs via _lockbox_, and one‑click ZIP export of your entire account.
- **API functionality** – Experimental XML‑RPC endpoint and JSON search API.
- **Zero‑Redis architecture** – Solid Cable and Solid Queue keep ActionCable and background jobs inside SQLite.
- **Security‑centric design** – CSP, Rack::Attack rate limiting, Brotli compression, and an evolving [security roadmap](todo.md).

## 🚀 Quick Start (Development)

1. **Clone the repository and install dependencies**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/libreverse.git
    cd libreverse
    bin/setup # installs Ruby gems, Node packages, and prepares the DB
    ```

2. **Launch the application**

    ```bash
    bin/dev # starts Rails and Vite in watch mode at http://localhost:3000
    ```

    In development, no external mailer is required; password‑reset links are output to the console.

### Prerequisites

- Ruby ≥ 3.4.1 (see .ruby-version)
- Bun ≥ 1.2 (front‑end package manager)
- SQLite ≥ 3.41 (compiled with FTS5 and JSON1)
- ImageMagick (for Active Storage variants)

Installation helpers:

## macOS / Ubuntu installation examples

```bash
# macOS
brew install ruby bun sqlite imagemagick

# Ubuntu
sudo apt install ruby-full bun curl sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev imagemagick
```

---

## 🐳 Running with Docker

```bash
docker build -t libreverse:alpha .
# Persist database and uploads
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v libreverse_data:/data libreverse:alpha
```

The image exposes port **3000** and stores the production SQLite database and uploaded files under `/data`.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance

```bash
bin/rails test                # Executes Minitest suite (unit + system)
bin/rubocop -A                # Lints and auto‑corrects Ruby code
bun run eslint .              # Lints JS/Coffee/Stimulus files
bun run stylelint "**/*.scss" # Lints SCSS stylesheets
```

Security audits (Brakeman, bundle‑audit, npm audit) run automatically in CI.
