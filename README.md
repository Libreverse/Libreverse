# Libreverse

## Development profiling

We ship with rack-mini-profiler enabled in development. It appears as a small badge in the top-right. Click it to toggle.

- Toggle visibility: the badge controls the panel; it starts hidden by default.
- Skips assets requests to reduce noise.
- Uses Redis for persistence when available (set REDIS_URL or default redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0).

Inline steps:

Use `DevProfiler.profile("Step name") { ... }` inside hotspots. Steps show up nested in the profiler UI.

Deeper profiles:

- StackProf sampling (wall/cpu/objects) with raw dumps you can analyze later:
    - `Profiler.stackprof(mode: :wall, out: "tmp/stackprof.dump") { do_work }`
- Flamegraph HTML output for visual call graphs:
    - `Profiler.flamegraph(out: "tmp/flamegraph.html") { do_work }`

Analyze StackProf dumps:

```sh
stackprof tmp/stackprof.dump --method --limit 20
stackprof tmp/stackprof.dump --json > tmp/stackprof.json
```

Libreverse is a privacy‑centric application for curating and sharing interactive "experiences" (self‑contained HTML documents). Powered by Hotwire, it delivers a seamless, single‑page‑application (SPA) experience entirely within the Ruby on Rails ecosystem while keeping all data on whatever instance you choose to use.

> **Alpha release** – this version is under active development. Expect breaking changes, incomplete features, and occasional rough edges. Planned work is tracked in our [road‑map](todo.md).

## ✨ Key Features

- **Local‑first data management** – SQLite (via the enhanced adapter) provides generated columns, JSON queries, and full‑text search without a separate database server.
- **Real‑time UI** – Turbo, Stimulus, and StimulusReflex enable instantaneous updates with minimal client‑side JavaScript.
- **Secure account system** – Rodauth with Argon2 hashing, email‑based login, remember‑me cookies, and optional guest mode.
- **ActivityPub Federation** – Share experiences across Libreverse instances using ActivityPub protocol with custom metaverse-specific fields.
- **Cross-instance Discovery** – Search and discover experiences from other federated Libreverse instances.
- **Media attachments** – Active Storage with rigorous validations, encrypted blobs at rest, and one‑click ZIP export of your entire account.
- **API functionality** – Full-featured GraphQL API, XML-RPC endpoints, JSON API, and integrated gRPC server with HTTP bridge.
- **Zero‑Redis architecture** – Solid Cable and Solid Queue keep ActionCable and background jobs inside SQLite.
- **Security‑centric design** – CSP, Rack::Attack rate limiting, Brotli compression, and an evolving [security roadmap](todo.md).
- **Collaborative Realtime** – WebSocket + Yjs CRDT layer providing durable shared state and ephemeral movement/presence without WebRTC complexity.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Development)

1. **Clone the repository and install dependencies**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/libreverse.git
    cd libreverse
    bin/setup # installs Ruby gems, Node packages, and prepares the DB
    ```

2. **Launch the application**

    ```bash
    bin/dev # starts Rails and Vite in watch mode at http://localhost:3000
    ```

    In development, no external mailer is required; password‑reset links are output to the console.

### Prerequisites

- Ruby ≥ 3.4.2 (see .ruby-version)
- Bun ≥ 1.2 (front‑end package manager)
- SQLite ≥ 3.41 (compiled with FTS5 and JSON1)
- ImageMagick (for Active Storage variants)

Installation helpers:

## macOS / Ubuntu installation examples

```bash
# macOS
brew install ruby bun sqlite imagemagick

# Ubuntu
sudo apt install ruby-full bun curl sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev imagemagick
```

## 🌐 ActivityPub Federation

Libreverse supports decentralized federation using the ActivityPub protocol, allowing instances to share experiences while maintaining local control.

### Federation Features

- **Experience Sharing**: Framework for sharing approved experiences with federated instances
- **Cross-Instance Discovery**: Search framework for finding content from other Libreverse instances
- **Custom ActivityPub Fields**: Rich metadata for metaverse experiences using Libreverse extensions
- **Privacy Controls**: Users can choose whether to federate each experience
- **Admin Tools**: Complete federation management interface for instance administrators

### Configuration

Set your instance domain in environment variables:

```bash
export INSTANCE_DOMAIN=your-domain.com
```

Admin users can manage federation settings at `/admin/federation`. Federation is implemented with a simplified delivery approach to ensure stability - full ActivityPub delivery can be enabled when desired.

For detailed federation documentation, see [`documentation/federation.md`](documentation/federation.md).

## 🐳 Running with Docker

> **Note:** Building the Docker image requires at least 8 GB of available memory, though the running container itself needs very little memory. If you encounter out-of-memory errors during the build, try increasing your Docker memory limit.

```bash
docker build -t libreverse:alpha .
# Persist database and uploads
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v libreverse_data:/data libreverse:alpha
```

The image exposes port **3000** and stores the production SQLite database and uploaded files under `/data`.

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance

Quality checks now run automatically via GitHub Actions CI on every push and pull request.

To run quality checks manually (original script preserved):

```bash
perl scripts/static.pl
```

## Column Encryption

Sensitive columns in Rodauth tables are encrypted using Sequel's built-in `column_encryption` plugin. The encryption key is a 32-byte value derived from `Rails.application.secret_key_base` using `ActiveSupport::KeyGenerator` (see `config/initializers/sequel_encryption.rb`).

- **Key Management:** The key is stable as long as `secret_key_base` does not change. If it does, you must re-encrypt existing data.
- **Encrypted Columns:**
    - `accounts.password_hash`
    - `account_remember_keys.key` (searchable)
    - `account_password_reset_keys.key` (searchable)
- **Database Constraints:**
    - Encrypted columns have `CHECK` constraints to ensure only encrypted data is stored (see `db/migrate/20250501000000_add_column_encryption_constraints_to_rodauth.rb`).

No additional gem is required; this uses Sequel's built-in plugin. All Rodauth features continue to work seamlessly with encrypted data.

## Caveats

If you deploy Libreverse behind a reverse proxy (such as Nginx, Apache, or a cloud load balancer), you **must** ensure that the proxy sets the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header on all requests. This header is used by Rails and middleware to correctly identify whether the original request was made over HTTP or HTTPS. If this header is missing or misconfigured, you may experience issues such as:

- Incorrect URL generation (e.g., HTTP links on an HTTPS site)
- Broken redirects or authentication flows
- Security features (like secure cookies or CSP) not working as intended

**Solution:**

- For Nginx, add: `proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;`
- For Apache, add: `RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto expr=%{REQUEST_SCHEME}`
- For cloud providers, consult their documentation to ensure this header is set.
