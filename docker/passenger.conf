# Passenger tuning (core directives passenger_root / passenger_ruby are set in nginx-main.conf)
# Keep only essentials here to avoid duplicate directive errors.
# No explicit pool caps; allow scaling per Passenger defaults/environment.
# passenger_pre_start is generated at startup from PASSENGER_PRESTART_URL (see entrypoint)
